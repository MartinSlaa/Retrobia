## TicTacToe Instructions
Tic tac toe, also known as noughts and crosses, is a classic game, usually played with pen and paper, however, this time presented in digital form.
The game's objective is for two players, X and O, to take turns to try to get three pieces of their symbol in a row. This could be diagonally, horizontally or vertically. 
This version of the classic game is played by clicking on a square, where the symbol of the current player is then placed. The game always starts with X going first, which means O goes second. The game continues until someone wins or the game ends in a draw. Once someone wins, a win screen is presented and the score is updated. If the game ends in a draw, a draw screen is presented, but the score stays the same. The players are presented with an option to restart the game by pressing *R* on the keyboard. 
 
**Note!**
The board can also be reset at any time, by pressing the *R*-key on the keyboard.
