## Invaders Instructions
[Based on the classic Space Invaders, Invaders goal is to see how many levels you can complete
before you succumb to the sear numbers of enemies and enemy fire!
When you start the game, you are greeted with a startup screen where you have to press SPACE to start playing.
The spaceship is maneuvered by using W, A, S, D and you can fire on enemy ships by pressing SPACE.
At the first level you fight against 5 enemies and as you progress each level adds five more enemies. You are rewarded points for each level you complete.

Pro tip!
Enemy lasers disappear when you destroy the enemy ship that fired that laser.
Playing aggressively can help you survive longer!]
